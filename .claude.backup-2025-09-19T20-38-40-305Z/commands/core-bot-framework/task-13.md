### Requirements
# Requirements Document - Core Bot Framework

## Introduction

The Core Bot Framework is a foundational Telegram bot implementation using Aiogram 3 that provides essential functionality for user interaction and system management. This framework serves as the base infrastructure for a Telegram bot with basic command handling, webhook connectivity, and menu navigation capabilities. The bot will establish the core communication layer between users and the bot's services through standardized command interfaces and secure webhook handling.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature establishes the fundamental infrastructure required for any Telegram bot application, providing a solid foundation for future feature development and user engagement through reliable messaging capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Telegram Bot Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure a Telegram bot using Aiogram 3 framework, so that the bot can connect to Telegram's API and handle user interactions securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot is initialized THEN the system SHALL establish a connection with Telegram API using a valid bot token
2. WHEN the bot token is invalid THEN the system SHALL log an appropriate error and fail gracefully
3. WHEN the bot is configured THEN the system SHALL support both polling and webhook modes for receiving updates
4. WHEN the bot starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required configuration parameters before beginning operation

### Requirement 2: Basic Command Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the bot using basic commands like /start and /menu, so that I can begin using the bot's functionality and navigate its features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends /start command THEN the bot SHALL respond with a welcome message and basic usage instructions
2. WHEN a user sends /menu command THEN the bot SHALL display the main menu with available options
3. WHEN a user sends an unrecognized command THEN the bot SHALL respond with a helpful message explaining available commands
4. WHEN commands are executed THEN the bot SHALL respond within 3 seconds under normal network conditions
5. WHEN multiple users send commands simultaneously THEN the bot SHALL handle all requests without blocking

### Requirement 3: Webhook Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to connect the bot to Telegram API using webhooks, so that the bot can receive real-time updates efficiently without constant polling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webhook mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL configure a secure HTTPS endpoint for receiving Telegram updates
2. WHEN a webhook receives an update THEN the system SHALL process it asynchronously without blocking other requests
3. WHEN webhook configuration fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to polling mode and log the webhook error
4. WHEN the webhook endpoint receives invalid requests THEN the system SHALL reject them and log security warnings
5. WHEN webhook SSL certificate is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail with a clear error message during configuration

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can monitor bot performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error with timestamp, severity level, and context information
2. WHEN a user encounters an error THEN the bot SHALL respond with a user-friendly error message without exposing system details
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt graceful recovery and continue operating if possible
4. WHEN the bot is unable to send a message THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts

### Requirement 5: Message Processing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a structured message processing system, so that different types of user inputs can be handled appropriately and extensibly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a text message is received THEN the system SHALL route it to the appropriate handler based on content
2. WHEN an unsupported message type is received THEN the bot SHALL inform the user about supported message types
3. WHEN message processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL send a "processing" indicator to the user
4. WHEN message handlers are registered THEN the system SHALL support middleware for preprocessing and postprocessing

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- The bot SHALL respond to commands within 3 seconds under normal conditions
- The system SHALL handle at least 100 concurrent users without performance degradation
- Memory usage SHALL not exceed 512MB during normal operation

### Security
- All communication with Telegram API SHALL use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Bot token SHALL be stored securely using environment variables
- Webhook endpoint SHALL validate incoming request signatures
- User input SHALL be sanitized to prevent injection attacks

### Reliability
- The bot SHALL have 99% uptime during operational hours
- System SHALL automatically restart after crashes with state preservation
- Failed message deliveries SHALL be retried with exponential backoff
- Critical errors SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging

### Usability
- Command responses SHALL be clear and include helpful instructions
- Error messages SHALL be user-friendly and actionable
- Menu navigation SHALL be intuitive with clear option descriptions
- Bot SHALL provide help documentation accessible via commands

# Design Document - Core Bot Framework

## Overview

The Core Bot Framework establishes a modern, scalable Telegram bot architecture using Aiogram 3. The design emphasizes clean separation of concerns, extensibility, and maintainability through a layered architecture with clear boundaries between configuration, routing, handlers, and services. This foundation enables rapid development of bot features while maintaining code quality and system reliability.

## Steering Document Alignment

   - **User Impact:** Bot fails to start with clear configuration error message

2. **Webhook Configuration Failure**
   - **Handling:** Log warning, fallback to polling mode automatically
   - **User Impact:** No impact, transparent fallback maintains functionality

3. **Message Processing Timeout**
   - **Handling:** Log timeout, send "processing" message to user, retry with backoff
   - **User Impact:** User sees processing indicator, eventually receives response or timeout message

4. **Network Connectivity Issues**
   - **Handling:** Implement exponential backoff, queue messages for retry
   - **User Impact:** Delayed responses, but eventual delivery guaranteed

5. **Unhandled Command or Message**
   - **Handling:** Route to default handler, log for analytics
   - **User Impact:** Helpful message explaining available commands
