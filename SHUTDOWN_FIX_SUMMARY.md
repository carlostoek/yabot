# Bot Shutdown Fix Summary

## Problem
The bot was not shutting down properly because:
1. `sys.exit(0)` was being called within an async function (`shutdown_bot`), causing a `SystemExit` exception that wasn't properly handled in the asyncio event loop context.
2. Signal handlers were directly creating asyncio tasks, which is not the proper way to handle signals in an asyncio application.
3. Background tasks were not being properly cancelled during shutdown.
4. Error handling in `BotApplication.stop()` was not robust enough.
5. The `background_tasks` global variable was referenced but not defined, causing a runtime error.

## Solution
We implemented the following fixes:

### 1. Removed `sys.exit(0)` from `shutdown_bot` function
- Replaced `sys.exit(0)` with a graceful approach that allows the main loop to detect when the bot is no longer running and exit naturally.

### 2. Fixed signal handler implementation
- Used `asyncio.Event` for shutdown coordination instead of directly creating tasks from signal handlers.
- Used `loop.call_soon_threadsafe()` for thread-safe scheduling of the shutdown event.
- Modified the main loop to wait for either 1 second or the shutdown event using `asyncio.wait_for()`.

### 3. Added proper task cancellation mechanism
- Added a global `background_tasks` set to track background tasks.
- Implemented proper cancellation of all background tasks during shutdown with timeout handling.
- Added wait for tasks to complete cancellation.

### 4. Improved error handling in `BotApplication.stop()`
- Added timeout handling for all async operations.
- Added better exception handling for each component shutdown.
- Ensured the bot is marked as not running even if there are errors during shutdown.

### 5. Added graceful shutdown mechanism
- Used asyncio events instead of `sys.exit(0)` for shutdown coordination.
- Ensured all components are properly cleaned up before shutdown.
- Added proper resource cleanup for database connections, event bus, cache manager, etc.

### 6. Fixed missing global variable definition
- Added the missing `background_tasks` global variable definition.
- Ensured all global variables are properly defined at the module level.

## Testing
Created test scripts that verify:
1. `shutdown_bot` function completes without calling `sys.exit(0)`
2. Signal handlers are properly registered and use thread-safe scheduling
3. Background tasks are properly tracked and cancelled
4. All required global variables are defined in the source file

## Files Modified
- `src/main.py` - Main shutdown logic, signal handling, and global variable definitions
- `src/core/application.py` - Improved `BotApplication.stop()` method

These changes ensure that the bot shuts down gracefully without hanging or throwing unhandled exceptions.
