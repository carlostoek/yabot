# Requirements Document - Menu System

## Introduction

The menu system for YABOT is a comprehensive user interaction interface that provides a fully functional, role-based navigation system for users to interact with all bot features. The system integrates the existing MenuFactory architecture with Telegram bot handlers, callbacks, and routers to create a seamless user experience that embodies Lucien's sophisticated voice and personality while respecting the organic menu design principles.

This system serves as the primary interface between users and all bot functionality, including narrative progression, gamification features, VIP access, administrative tools, and emotional intelligence systems.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports YABOT's core mission of creating emotionally intelligent digital companions by:

- **Emotional Connection**: Using Lucien's sophisticated voice throughout all menu interactions to maintain personality consistency
- **Personalized Experience**: Adapting menu options and presentations based on user archetype, narrative level, and worthiness score
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Implementing the organic menu system that shows all options with elegant restrictions rather than hiding unavailable features
- **User Growth**: Supporting the Diana system's 6-level progression (Kinkys 1-3, Div√°n 4-6) through adaptive menu presentations
- **VIP Differentiation**: Providing exclusive access and enhanced experiences for premium subscribers
- **Authentic Interaction**: Maintaining the sophisticated butler persona that analyzes user worthiness and guides their journey
