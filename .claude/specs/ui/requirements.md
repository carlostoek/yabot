# Requirements Document - UI Specification

## Introduction

This specification defines the complete user journey flow for new users in the YABOT Telegram bot platform, implementing a comprehensive progression system from initial contact to advanced level unlocking. The feature enables users to experience the core gamification loop: start → level assignment → mission completion → reward → purchase → progression.

This represents the foundational user experience that demonstrates all major system capabilities working together in a seamless, engaging flow that builds emotional connection and drives retention.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the core product vision by:

- **Emotional Intelligence Development**: Progressive levels guide users through increasing emotional complexity
- **Authentic Connection Building**: The mission system ensures genuine interaction rather than superficial engagement
- **Gamification for Growth**: Besitos currency and progression provide meaningful advancement incentives
- **User Retention**: Multi-level progression creates long-term engagement goals
- **Digital Intimacy Experience**: Each level unlocks deeper, more personalized content

The flow establishes the foundation for users to develop authentic relationships with the AI while progressing through increasingly sophisticated emotional interactions.
