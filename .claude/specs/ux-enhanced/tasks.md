# Implementation Plan - UX Enhanced Interface

## Task Overview

This implementation plan addresses the UX Enhanced Interface requirements through atomic, technically-specific tasks that integrate Lucien as the primary voice interface while ensuring Diana appears only in special moments. All tasks have been optimized for agent execution based on validator feedback, prioritizing atomic scope, concrete technical implementation details, and proper integration with existing systems.

## Steering Document Compliance

### Technical Standards Integration (tech.md)
- All tasks ensure <500ms menu generation and <3 second response times
- Implementation leverages existing event-driven architecture for scalability
- Database integration maintains dual MongoDB/SQLite structure without migration
- Security and role-based access built upon existing authentication framework

### Project Structure Alignment (structure.md)
- Tasks respect existing modular organization (/src/modules/, /src/handlers/, /src/services/)
- Integration enhances existing MenuFactory system without architectural changes
- Service layer extensions follow established dependency injection patterns
- Event bus integration maintains current pub/sub messaging architecture

## Atomic Task Requirements

**Each task meets these criteria for optimal agent execution:**
- **File Scope**: Touches 1-3 related files maximum
- **Time Boxing**: Completable in 15-30 minutes
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
- **Specific Files**: Must specify exact files to create/modify
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching

## Task Format Guidelines

- Use checkbox format: `- [ ] Task number. Task description`
- **Specify files**: Always include exact file paths to create/modify
- **Include implementation details** as bullet points
- Reference requirements using: `_Requirements: Requirement X.Y_`
- Reference existing code to leverage using: `_Leverage: path/to/file.py, existing_class_name_`
- Focus only on coding tasks (no deployment, user testing, etc.)
- **Avoid broad terms**: No "system", "integration", "complete" in task titles

## Good vs Bad Task Examples

❌ **Bad Examples (Too Broad)**:
- "Implement authentication system" (affects many files, multiple purposes)
- "Add user management features" (vague scope, no file specification)
- "Build complete dashboard" (too large, multiple components)

✅ **Good Examples (Atomic)**:
- "Create LucienVoiceProfile dataclass in src/ui/lucien_voice_generator.py with formality_level field"
- "Add get_lucien_relationship_state() method to UserService class in src/services/user.py"
- "Modify MenuItem class in src/ui/menu_factory.py to include lucien_voice_text field"
