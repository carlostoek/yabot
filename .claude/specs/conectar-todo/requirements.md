# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for connecting and integrating all services, modules, and components within the YABOT system. The goal is to establish robust communication channels, event-driven workflows, and service orchestration to create a unified, cohesive bot ecosystem where all components work harmoniously together.

Currently, the system has modular components that are partially isolated. This feature will create the "electrical wiring" of the bot, ensuring seamless data flow, event propagation, and service coordination across all layers from core infrastructure to user-facing features.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the core architectural goals by:
- Establishing reliable service-to-service communication patterns
- Creating event-driven workflows that enable real-time responsiveness
- Ensuring data consistency across multiple databases and services
- Providing a solid foundation for all user-facing features (gamification, narratives, administration)
- Enabling scalable and maintainable system architecture

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Services Orchestration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all core services (application, router, middleware, error handler) to be properly orchestrated, so that command processing, event handling, and error management work reliably across the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize core services in the correct dependency order (config → database → events → user service → handlers)
2. WHEN a command is received THEN the system SHALL route it through middleware pipeline and error handler before reaching the appropriate handler
3. WHEN an error occurs in any service THEN the error handler SHALL capture it, log contextual information, and provide graceful degradation
4. WHEN the router receives an update THEN the system SHALL process it through the complete middleware chain and return appropriate responses

### Requirement 2: User Service and Database Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the user service to seamlessly interact with both MongoDB and SQLite databases, so that user profiles and states can be consistently managed across the dual-database architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create records in both SQLite (profile) and MongoDB (state) databases atomically
2. WHEN user data is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency between both databases and publish relevant events
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper rollback mechanisms and retry strategies
4. WHEN user context is requested THEN the system SHALL efficiently aggregate data from both databases
5. IF one database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with degraded functionality and queue operations for later sync

### Requirement 3: Event Bus Integration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the event bus to connect all services and modules, so that actions in one component trigger appropriate responses in other components throughout the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user claims a daily gift THEN the system SHALL publish an event that triggers wallet updates, achievement checks, and notification processing
2. WHEN events are published THEN the system SHALL deliver them to all registered subscribers with guaranteed delivery mechanisms
3. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue events locally and process them when Redis reconnects
4. WHEN services start THEN the system SHALL automatically register their event subscriptions with the event bus
5. WHEN events fail to process THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff and dead letter queues

### Requirement 4: Gamification Module Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want gamification features (wallet, daily gifts, missions, store, achievements) to be fully integrated through the event system, so that my actions in one area automatically trigger appropriate updates and rewards across all other gamification modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a mission THEN the system SHALL update besitos wallet, check for achievements, and trigger relevant notifications
2. WHEN a user makes a store purchase THEN the system SHALL deduct besitos, update inventory, and publish transaction events
3. WHEN daily gifts are claimed THEN the system SHALL update wallet balance, mission progress, and achievement tracking
4. WHEN auction events occur THEN the system SHALL coordinate wallet transactions, inventory updates, and winner notifications
5. WHEN trivia is completed THEN the system SHALL award besitos, update achievements, and track progress across the gamification system

### Requirement 5: Narrative Engine Integration

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the narrative engine to be fully integrated with user service and gamification modules, so that storytelling dynamically adapts based on real-time user progress and choices trigger coordinated updates across all connected systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN narrative content is requested THEN the system SHALL access user missions, achievements, and choices to personalize the story
2. WHEN users make narrative choices THEN the system SHALL update story progression and trigger relevant gamification events
3. WHEN story milestones are reached THEN the system SHALL award appropriate rewards and update user achievement progress
4. WHEN narrative events occur THEN the system SHALL coordinate with mission manager to update quest progress
5. IF narrative service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback content while maintaining user progress tracking

### Requirement 6: Administrative System Integration

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want administrative tools (notifications, access control, scheduling, message protection) to be fully integrated with the core system, so that I can manage the bot effectively while monitoring all connected services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN administrators send notifications THEN the system SHALL deliver them through the event bus to appropriate user segments
2. WHEN access control rules are updated THEN the system SHALL immediately enforce them across all services and modules
3. WHEN scheduled posts are triggered THEN the system SHALL coordinate with user service and gamification modules as needed
4. WHEN administrative actions occur THEN the system SHALL log them and publish audit events for monitoring
5. WHEN system health is checked THEN the administrative interface SHALL display status of all connected services and databases

### Requirement 7: API REST Integration

**User Story:** As an external developer, I want the REST API to provide unified access to all internal services, so that external systems can interact with user data, gamification features, and narrative content through a consistent interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL coordinate responses using the same internal services that power the bot
2. WHEN API operations modify data THEN the system SHALL publish the same events that internal operations generate
3. WHEN API requests require user data THEN the system SHALL use the unified user service to aggregate information from both databases
4. WHEN external systems trigger gamification actions THEN the system SHALL process them through the same event-driven workflows as internal actions
5. IF internal services are degraded THEN the API SHALL return appropriate error responses with service status information

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Service initialization SHALL complete within 10 seconds under normal conditions
- Event publishing SHALL have a latency of less than 100ms for local events and less than 500ms for Redis-based events
- Database operations SHALL maintain sub-200ms response times for user operations
- Cross-service communication SHALL not introduce more than 50ms of additional latency per service call
- Service-to-service API calls SHALL complete within 1 second for standard operations
- Event processing throughput SHALL handle at least 100 events per second during peak load

### Security
- All inter-service communication SHALL use authenticated channels
