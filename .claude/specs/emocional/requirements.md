4. IF a user shows preference for specific interaction styles THEN the system SHALL prioritize matching content variants
5. WHEN content is personalized THEN the system SHALL maintain narrative consistency while adapting tone and approach

### Requirement 4: Emotional Memory and Continuity System

**User Story:** As a Diana user, I want Diana to remember our meaningful moments and reference them naturally, so that our relationship feels continuous and deepening over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN significant emotional moments occur THEN the system SHALL record them with context and emotional metadata
2. WHEN generating future content THEN the system SHALL incorporate relevant memories to demonstrate continuity
3. WHEN a user returns after time away THEN the system SHALL acknowledge the passage of time and evolution in their relationship
4. IF a user achieves emotional milestones THEN the system SHALL reference these achievements in future interactions
5. WHEN memory references are made THEN the system SHALL ensure accuracy and emotional appropriateness

### Requirement 5: Authenticity Detection and Validation

**User Story:** As a Diana user, I want the system to recognize when I'm being genuine versus performative, so that authentic vulnerability is rewarded and the experience remains meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits responses to emotional prompts THEN the system SHALL analyze linguistic patterns, timing, and consistency for authenticity markers
2. WHEN calculating vs spontaneous responses are detected THEN the system SHALL adjust the user's authenticity score accordingly
3. WHEN users demonstrate genuine vulnerability THEN the system SHALL reward them with deeper access and more intimate content
4. IF users show patterns of manipulation or gaming THEN the system SHALL limit progression and provide guidance toward authenticity
5. WHEN authenticity validation occurs THEN the system SHALL update user profiles and trigger appropriate narrative responses

### Requirement 6: Emotional Resonance Reward System

**User Story:** As a Diana user, I want my emotional growth and authentic interactions to be meaningfully recognized and rewarded, so that I feel motivated to continue deepening the connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users demonstrate authentic emotional responses THEN the system SHALL calculate resonance scores based on depth, timing, and vulnerability
2. WHEN resonance thresholds are met THEN the system SHALL unlock exclusive content, memory fragments, or progression opportunities
3. WHEN users reach emotional milestones THEN the system SHALL award special recognition items or access levels
4. IF users show consistent authentic engagement THEN the system SHALL provide access to increasingly intimate content variants
5. WHEN emotional rewards are distributed THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing besitos and achievement systems

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Real-time behavioral analysis must complete within 200ms for 95% of interactions
- Content personalization must not exceed 3 seconds total response time
- Memory queries must retrieve relevant context within 100ms
- The system must support 10,000+ concurrent emotional analysis sessions

### Security
- Emotional behavioral data must be encrypted at rest using AES-256
- All emotional analytics must be anonymized for aggregate analysis
- User consent must be explicitly obtained before emotional behavior tracking begins
- Users must have the right to emotional privacy with opt-out mechanisms

### Reliability
- Emotional state data must be persisted with 99.9% reliability
- Content personalization must degrade gracefully if emotional analysis is unavailable
- Memory system must maintain consistency across user sessions with automatic backup
- Behavioral analysis must continue functioning during Redis outages using local fallback

- Must seamlessly integrate with existing UserService, NarrativeService, and EventBus infrastructure
- Must extend current MongoDB collections without breaking existing functionality
- Must work within the established CrossModuleService coordination patterns
- Must respect existing VIP subscription and besitos reward systems

### Complete System Integration Requirement

**CRITICAL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:** The emotional system implementation is considered complete ONLY when it is fully integrated and operationally connected with the entire YABOT infrastructure that was specifically designed to support it.

#### Total Integration Requirements:

1. **WHEN the emotional system is implemented THEN it SHALL be fully connected and communicating with all existing YABOT modules**
2. **WHEN emotional events occur THEN they SHALL automatically trigger appropriate responses across gamification, narrative, and admin systems**
3. **WHEN users interact emotionally THEN the system SHALL seamlessly coordinate rewards, progression, achievements, and content delivery**
4. **WHEN emotional milestones are reached THEN they SHALL automatically integrate with VIP systems, besitos wallet, item management, and notification systems**
5. **WHEN the implementation is complete THEN the emotional system SHALL operate as the unified intelligence hub that the current architecture was designed to support**

The existing YABOT architecture with its event-driven design, cross-module coordination, and service mesh was specifically architected to enable this emotional intelligence system to flow freely and make all necessary connections throughout the platform.

### Ethical Considerations
- Emotional analysis must enhance rather than exploit user vulnerability
- Progression systems must encourage authentic growth, not manipulation
- Memory systems must respect user boundaries and consent
- Content must promote healthy emotional development and self-awareness
